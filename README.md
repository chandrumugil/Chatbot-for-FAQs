This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify and respond to user input. It combines intent recognition, entity extraction, and response generation through rule-based logic or ML models like BERT or Rasa.

Intent Detection: Determines what the user wants (e.g., ask about a course)

Entity Recognition: Extracts key information (e.g., course name)

Frameworks: Rasa, ChatterBot, spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers

Interface: Flask/Streamlit UI or Telegram Bot API
